summary: ''
abstract: 'The Kaczmarz algorithm is an iterative technique designed to solve consistent linear systems of equations. It falls within the category of row-action methods, focusing on handling one equation per
iteration. This characteristic makes it especially useful in solving very large systems. A notable real-world application of the Kaczmarz algorithm is to reconstruct images of scanned bodies during a Computed Tomography (CT scan). Improving the performance of this algorithm can be achieved through parallelization, which is not a straightforward technique, particularly for iterative methods.
