summary: 
abstract: 'Contamination flows are very important in many applications, which are characterized by transport and nonlinear reaction processes in large-scale and long-term prediction and protection. In general, the nonlinear reactions can be described as the kinetically controlled dissolution precipitation reactions or the geochemical equilibrium reactions as hydrolysis aqueous complexation, oxidation-reduction, ion exchange, surface complexation, and gas dissolution-exsolution reactions. In atmospheric pollution, the reaction process involves nonlinear multicomponent aerosol dynamic process. In this talk, we will first
introduce the conservation laws of contamination flows and the coupled nonlinear PDEs for describing contamination flows. We will then present our development of efficient domain-decomposition schemes for solving convection diffusion problems and parabolic problems and for solving contamination flows in parallel computing. We will also present block-centered compact difference methods for solving the time-dependent partial differential equations and report the block-centered compact S-DDM scheme. Numerical experiments are given to show their performances. The developed algorithms work efficiently over multiple sub-domains, which can be applied in simulation of contamination flows.'
