Víctor Bayona received his PhD degree in Engineering Mathematics from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in 2013. He served as a Postdoctoral Fellow from 2013 to 2015 in the Advanced Study Program (ASP) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO (USA). From 2015 to 2017 he held research positions in the Numerical Aspects Section at ECMWF, Reading (UK), and the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Bath (UK).

In 2017, he joined the Department of Mathematics at UC3M as a Visiting Professor and has been serving as an Associate Professor since 2021. His research is focused on advancing and applying numerical methods for PDEs, with a particular emphasis on meshfree methods based on radial basis functions (RBFs).
