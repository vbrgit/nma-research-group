Jorge Morón-Vidal got his Bachelor of Science in Physics in 2018 from the University of Zaragoza. In 2019, he completed a Master's in General Physics from the University of Zaragoza and Cergy Paris University. Since 2019, he has been a mathematical engineering PhD candidate at UC3M, supervised by Dr Francisco Bernal. It is expected that he will defend his PhD in early 2024. His research interests include probabilistic domain decomposition algorithms, numerical methods for PDE solving and high parallel computing.
