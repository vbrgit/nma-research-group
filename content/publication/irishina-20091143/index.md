abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel shape reconstruction technique
  for the early detection of breast cancer from microwave data, which is based on
  a level-set technique. The shape-based approach offers several advantages compared
  to more traditional pixel-based approaches when targeting the reconstruction of
  key characteristics of a hidden tumor such as its correct size, shape, and static
  permittivity value. In addition to these key characteristics of hidden tumors, we
  aim at estimating the correct interfaces between fatty and fibroglandular tissue
  in the breast and their internal permittivity profiles. The level set strategy (which
  is an implicit representation of the shapes) frees us from topological restrictions
  when reconstructing an a priori arbitrary number of tumors and the often quite complicated
  interfaces between fatty and fibroglandular regions. The presented strategy is able
  to detect and, in most cases, characterize tumors whose sizes (diameters) are much
  smaller than the wavelengths of the electromagnetic waves that are used for illuminating
  the breast. We present numerical results for a 2-D model with two distinct tissue
  types (fatty and fibroglandular) in the interior of the breast (in addition to a
  possible tumor and the surrounding skin). Our results demonstrate the performance
  and potential of our scheme in various simulated but realistic situations. Â© 2006
