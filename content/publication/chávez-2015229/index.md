abstract: The reconstruction of cardiac ischemic regions from body surface potential
  measurements (BSPMs) is usually performed at a single time instant which corresponds
  to the plateau or resting phase of the cardiac action potential. Using a different
  approach, we previously proposed a level set formulation that incorporates the knowledge
  of the cardiac excitation process in the inverse procedure, thus exploiting the
  spatio-temporal correlations contained in the BSPMs. In this study, we extend our
  inverse level-set formulation for the reconstruction of ischemic regions to 3D realistic
  geometries, and analyze its performance in different noisy scenarios. Our method
  is benchmarked against zero-order Tikhonov regularization. The inverse reconstruction
  of the ischemic region is evaluated using the correlation coefficient (CC), the
  sensitive error ratio (SN), and the specificity error ratio (SP). Our algorithm
  outperforms zero-order Tikhonov regularization, specially in highly noisy scenarios.
