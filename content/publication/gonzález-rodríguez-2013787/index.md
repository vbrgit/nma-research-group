abstract: We study optical imaging of tissues in the mesoscopic scattering regime
  in which light multiply scatters in tissues but is not fully diffusive. We use the
  radiative transport equation to model light propagation and an l 1-optimization
  method to solve the inverse source problem. We show that recovering the location
  and strength of several point-like sources that are close to each other is not possible
  when using angle-averaged measurements. The image reliability is limited by a spatial
  scale that is on the order of the transport mean-free path, even under the most
  ideal conditions. However, by using just a few angle-resolved measurements, the
  proposed method is able to overcome this limitation. Â© 2013 Optical Society of America.
