abstract: We present a novel fluorescent tomography algorithm to estimate the spatial
  distribution of fluorophores and the fluorescence lifetimes from surface time resolved
  measurements. The algorithm is a hybridization of the level set technique for recovering
  the distributions of distinct fluorescent markers with a gradient method for estimating
  their lifetimes. This imaging method offers several advantages compared to more
  traditional pixel-based techniques as, for example, well defined boundaries and
  a better resolution of the images. The numerical experiments show that our imaging
  method gives rise to accurate reconstructions in the presence of data noise and
  fluorescence background even for complicated fluorophore distributions in several-centimiter-thick
  biological tissue.Â© 2009 Optical Society of America.
