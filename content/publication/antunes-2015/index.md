abstract: In this article we present a probabilistic spectral partition theory for
  a previously derived Monte Carlo method and show how to use it for the numerical
  simulation of Gaussian pulse propagation in a lossy transmission line with resistive
  boundary conditions. The spectral partition method consists in the random generation
  of frequencies, inside the source that feeds the line, and establishes the connection
  between the Monte Carlo line method and the tools of circuit analysis in the frequency
  domain. The main aspects regarding the implementation of this Monte Carlo algorithm
  are also addressed. Â© 2015 IEEE.
