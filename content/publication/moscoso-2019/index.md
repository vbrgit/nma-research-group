abstract: In this paper, we study the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm
  often used to image small targets when multiple measurement vectors are available.
  We show that this algorithm may be used when the imaging problem can be cast as
  a linear system that admits a special factorization. We discuss several active array
  imaging configurations where this factorization is exact, as well as other configurations
  where the factorization only holds approximately and, hence, the results provided
  by MUSIC deteriorate. We give special attention to the most general setting where
  an active array with an arbitrary number of transmitters and receivers uses signals
  of multiple frequencies to image the targets. This setting provides all the possible
  diversity of information that can be obtained from the illuminations. We give a
  theorem that shows that MUSIC is robust with respect to additive noise provided
  that the targets are well separated. The theorem also shows the relevance of using
  appropriate sets of controlled parameters, such as excitations, to form the images
  with MUSIC robustly. We present numerical experiments that support our theoretical
  results. Â© 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.
