abstract: We consider narrow band, active array imaging of localized scatterers in
  a homogeneous medium with and without additive noise. We consider both single and
  multiple illuminations and study ℓ1 minimization-based imaging methods. We show
  that for large arrays, with array diameter comparable to range, and when scatterers
  are sparse and well separated, ℓ1 minimization using a single illumination and without
  additive noise can recover the location and reflectivity of the scatterers exactly.
  For multiple illuminations, we introduce a hybrid method which combines the singular
  value decomposition and ℓ1 minimization. This method can be used when the essential
  singular vectors of the array response matrix are available. We show that with this
  hybrid method we can recover the location and reflectivity of the scatterers exactly
  when there is no noise in the data. Numerical simulations indicate that the hybrid
  method is, in addition, robust to noise in the data. We also compare the ℓ1 minimization-based
  methods with others including Kirchhoff migration, ℓ2 minimization and multiple
  signal classification. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.
