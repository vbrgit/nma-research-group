abstract: An inversion algorithm is presented that is based on hybridization of the
  adjoint scheme for calculating gradient directions with the method of moments. The
  goal is to reconstruct the shapes of 3-D objects immersed in a lossy medium. The
  irregular shape of the reference object is modeled by a representation with spherical
  harmonics functions, whereas during the reconstruction, individual surface nodes
  are updated. In the adjoint scheme, gradient directions for the least squares data
  misfit cost functional are calculated by solving the forward problem twice in each
  iteration, regardless of the number of spherical harmonics parameters used in the
  reference model or the number of surface nodes used for the discretization of the
  shapes. The numerical results show that implementing the well known frequency hopping
  technique helps the algorithm avoid dropping in local minima. Â© 2009 IEEE.
