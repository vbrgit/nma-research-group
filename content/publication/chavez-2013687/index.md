abstract: The Inverse Problem of electrocardiography (IPE) can be summarized as the
  characterization of the electrical behavior of the heart using measurements obtained
  by electrodes that are not directly in contact with the cardiac surfaces. Given
  a data ensemble provided by electrodes, the solution of the IPE requires the design
  of a mathematical procedure that matches a theoretical model of estimated measurements
  with that ensemble of data. Common tests of inversion procedures were often made
  with synthetic data using the same model for computing both predicted and estimated
  measurements, yielding into overoptimistic results; this is called the Inverse Crime.
  In practice, the test of an inversion process avoiding the Inverse Crime could be
  done using a model for the numerically produced simulated data and a different one
  to invert the data. This work shows the behavior of a procedure designed to characterize
  regions in the heart with a lack of blood supply (ischemia) avoiding the Inverse
  Crime. Realistic and experimentally supported models constitute the forward procedure
  (the Luo-Rudy model for the electrical activity and the volume conductor theory
  for simulating the electrode measurements) while a simple phenomenological model
  (the two-current model proposed by Mitchell and Schaeffer) is used during the inversion
  process. Â© 2013 CCAL.
