abstract: The problem of sparse signal recovery from quadratic cross-correlation measurements
  is considered. Compared to the signal recovery problem that uses linear data, the
  unknown here is a matrix, X=h̊o o̊^*, formed by the cross correlations of r,̊ a
  K-dimensional vector that is the unknown of the linear problem. Solving for X creates
  a bottleneck as the number of unknowns grows now quadratically in K. To solve this
  problem efficiently a dimension reduction approach is proposed in which the contribution
  of the off-diagonal terms rh̊i ρj̊^* for 퐢 neq 퐣 to the data is treated as noise
  and is absorbed using the Noise Collector [1]. With this approach, we recover the
  unknown X by solving a convex linear problem whose cost is similar to the one that
  uses linear measurements. © 2021 IEEE.
