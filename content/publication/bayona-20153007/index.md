abstract: A numerical model based on radial basis function-generated finite differences
  (RBF-FD) is developed for simulating the global electric circuit (GEC) within the
  Earth's atmosphere, represented by a 3-D variable coefficient linear elliptic partial
  differential equation (PDE) in a spherically shaped volume with the lower boundary
  being the Earth's topography and the upper boundary a sphere at 60 km. To our knowledge,
  this is (1) the first numerical model of the GEC to combine the Earth's topography
  with directly approximating the differential operators in 3-D space and, related
  to this, (2) the first RBF-FD method to use irregular 3-D stencils for discretization
  to handle the topography. It benefits from the mesh-free nature of RBF-FD, which
  is especially suitable for modeling high-dimensional problems with irregular boundaries.
  The RBF-FD elliptic solver proposed here makes no limiting assumptions on the spatial
  variability of the coefficients in the PDE (i.e., the conductivity profile), the
  right hand side forcing term of the PDE (i.e., distribution of current sources)
  or the geometry of the lower boundary. Â© Author(s) 2015.
