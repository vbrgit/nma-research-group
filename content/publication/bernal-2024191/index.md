abstract: The performance of stochastic numerical methods for bounded diffusions (accuracy,
  speed and weak rate of convergence) is considered. The backdrop is the pointwise
  solution, via stochastic representations, of boundary value problems with mixed
  boundary conditions. Three stochastic solvers are tested on application-inspired
  problems, and their performance is noticeably improved thanks to simple heuristics
  introduced here. Â© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland
