abstract: For a beam impinging on a scattering medium the diffusion approximation
  to the radiative transport equation is not valid for analyzing the radiance near
  the source, especially if the medium scatters strongly with a sharp forward peak.
  To analyze the radiance, we use the Fokker–Planck approximation to the radiative
  transport equation. Numerical results show a backscattered ring appearing around
  the beam center. It also appears in Monte Carlo simulations of the radiative transport
  equation. This ring is manifested from successive near-forward scattering events,
  so it requires a directional description. Therefore the diffusion approximation
  cannot predict this ring. © 2004 Optical Society of America.
