abstract: We propose a short-range generalization of the p-spin interaction spin-glass
  model. The model is well suited to test the idea that an entropy collapse is at
  the bottom line of the dynamical singularity encountered in structural glasses.
  The model is studied in three dimensions through Monte Carlo simulations, which
  put in evidence fragile glass behavior with stretched exponential relaxation and
  super-Arrhenius behavior of the relaxation time. Our data are in favor of a Vogel-Fulcher
  behavior of the relaxation time, related to an entropy collapse at the Kauzmann
  temperature. We, however, encounter difficulties analogous to those found in experimental
  systems when extrapolating thermodynamical data at low temperatures. We study the
  spin-glass susceptibility, investigating the behavior of the correlation length
  in the system. We find that the increase of the relaxation time is accompanied by
  a very slow growth of the correlation length. We discuss the scaling properties
  of off-equilibrium dynamics in the glassy regime, finding qualitative agreement
  with the mean-field theory. Â© 1996 The American Physical Society.
