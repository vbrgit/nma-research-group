abstract: Radial basis functions (RBFs) have become a popular method for the solution
  of partial differential equations. In this paper we analyze the applicability of
  both the global and the local versions of the method for elastostatic problems.
  We use multiquadrics as RBFs and describe how to select an optimal value of the
  shape parameter to minimize approximation errors. The selection of the optimal shape
  parameter is based on analytical approximations to the local error using either
  the same shape parameter at all nodes or a node-dependent shape parameter. We show
  through several examples using both equispaced and nonequispaced nodes that significant
  gains in accuracy result from a proper selection of the shape parameter. Â© 2013
