abstract: The dynamics of relativistic runaway electrons in tokamak plasmas is analyzed
  using a test particle description that includes acceleration in the toroidal electric
  field, collisions with the plasma particles, and deceleration due to synchrotron
  radiation losses. The region of momentum space in which electron runaway takes place
  is determined. It is found that relativistic and synchrotron radiation effects lead
  to a critical electric field ER &gt;(kTe/mec2)ED, below which no runaways are generated.
  In addition, the trajectories of the test electrons in momentum space show a stable
  equilibrium point that sets a limit on the energy that the runaway electrons can
  reach. Analytical expressions are given for this energy limit as a function of the
  toroidal electric field and plasma parameters. The dominant radiative mechanisms
  limiting the runaway electron energy are identified in the whole range of electric
  field values. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.
