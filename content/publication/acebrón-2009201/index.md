abstract: The effect of the topological structure of a coupled dynamical system in
  presence of noise on the signal response is investigated. In particular, we consider
  the response of a noisy overdamped bistable dynamical system driven by a periodic
  force, and linearly coupled through a complex network of interactions. We find that
  the interplay among the heterogeneity of the network and the noise plays a crucial
  role in the signal response of the dynamical system. This has been validated by
  extensive numerical simulations conducted in a variety of networks. Furthermore,
  we propose analytically tractable models based on simple topologies, which explain
  the observed behavior. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
