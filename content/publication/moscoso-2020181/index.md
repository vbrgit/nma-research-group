abstract: In this paper, we consider imaging problems that can be cast in the form
  of an underdetermined linear system of equations. When a single measurement vector
  is available, a sparsity promoting ℓ1-minimization-based algorithm may be used to
  solve the imaging problem efficiently. A suitable algorithm in the case of multiple
  measurement vectors would be the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) which is
  a subspace projection method. We provide in this work a theoretical framework in
  an abstract linear algebra setting that allows us to examine under what conditions
  the ℓ1-minimization problem and the MUSIC method admit an exact solution. We also
  examine the performance of these two approaches when the data are noisy. Several
  imaging configurations that fall under the assumptions of the theory are discussed
  such as active imaging with single-or multiple-frequency data. We also show that
  the phase-retrieval problem can be re-cast under the same linear system formalism
  using the polarization identity and relying on diversity of illuminations. The relevance
  of our theoretical analysis in imaging is illustrated with numerical simulations
  and robustness to noise is examined by allowing the background medium to be weakly
  inhomogeneous. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Munich/Boston.
