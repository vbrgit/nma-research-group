abstract: New micro-devices, such as unmanned aerial vehicles or micro-robots, have
  increased the demand of a new generation of small-scale combustion power system
  that go beyond the energy-density limitations of batteries or fuel cells. The characteristics
  short residence times and intense heat losses reduce the efficiency of combustion-based
  devices, a key factor that requires of an acute modelling effort to understand the
  competing physicochemical phenomena that hamper their efficient operation. With
  this objective in mind, this paper is devoted to the development of a high-order
  meshfree method to model combustion inside complex geometries using radial basis
  functions-generated finite differences (RBF-FD) based on polyharmonic splines (PHS)
  augmented with multivariate polynomials (PHS+poly). In our model, the combustion
  chamber of a micro-rotary engine is simulated by a system of unsteady reaction-diffusion
  equations coupled with a steady flow passing a bidimensional stenotic channel of
  great slenderness. The conversion efficiency is characterized by identifying the
  different combustion regimes that emerged as a function of the ignition point. We
  show that PHS+poly based RBF-FD is able to achieve high-order algebraic convergence
  on scattered node distributions, enabling for node refinement in key regions of
  the fluid domain. This feature makes it specially well adapted to integrate problems
  in irregular geometries with front-like solutions, such as reactive fronts or shock
  waves. Several numerical tests are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness
  of our approach. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.
