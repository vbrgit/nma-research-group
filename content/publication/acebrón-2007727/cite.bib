 abstract = {A comparison is made between the probabilistic domain decomposition (DD) method and a certain deterministic DD method for solving linear elliptic boundary-value problems. Since in the deterministic approach the CPU time is affected by intercommunications among the processors, it turns out that the probabilistic method performs better, especially when the number of subdomains (hence, of processors) is increased. This fact is clearly illustrated by some examples. The probabilistic DD algorithm has been implemented in an MPI environment, in order to exploit distributed computer architectures. Scalability and fault-tolerance of the probabilistic DD algorithm are emphasized. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},
