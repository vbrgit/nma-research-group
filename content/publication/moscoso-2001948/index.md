abstract: We present a study of the image blurring and depolarization resulting from
  the transmission of a narrow beam of light through a continuous random medium. We
  investigate the dependence of image quality degradation and of depolarization on
  optical thickness, correlation length of the inhomogeneities, and incident polarization
  state. This is done numerically with a Monte Carlo method based on a transport equation
  that takes into account polarization of light. We compare our results with those
  for transport in media with discrete spherical scatterers. We show that depolarization
  effects are different in these two models of biological tissue. Â© 2001 Optical Society
