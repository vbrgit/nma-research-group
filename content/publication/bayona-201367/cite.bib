 abstract = {In this work we explore the applicability of the RBF method to laminar flame propagation modeling. This method is specially well suited for the solution of problems with complex geometries and irregular boundaries where spectral methods can not be applied. Another important advantage is that the method is independent of the dimension of the problem and, therefore, it is very easy to apply in 3D problems with complex geometries. We use both the global and the local (RBF-FD) versions of the method and we show its applicability in the solution of flame propagation problems in one, two and three dimensions using equispaced and non-equispaced nodes.
