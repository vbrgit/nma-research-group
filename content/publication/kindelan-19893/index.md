abstract: For the correct interpretation of data gathered in the seismic prospecting
  of complex heterogeneous structures, elastic effects must often be taken into consideration.
  The use of the elastic wave equations to model the seismic response of an hypothesized
  geological structure is a valuable tool for relating observed seismic data to the
  earth's inhomogeneities and verify an interpretation. Several methods may be used
  to integrate numerically the partial differential equations describing elastic wave
  propagation. Pseudospectral (Fourier) methods represent the leading numerical integration
  technique. Their main advantage is high accuracy and suitability to vector and parallel
  computer architectures, while their main drawback is high computational cost. However,
  for a given accuracy, the required grid size with pseudospectral methods is smaller
  than that required by finite‐difference schemes, thus balancing the computational
  cost. We describe a two‐dimensional pseudospectral elastic model implemented on
  the vector multiprocessor IBM 3090 VF. The algorithm has been suitably adapted to
  fully exploit the computer architecture and thereby maximize the performance. The
  elastic model has been validated in a variety of problems in geophysics and, in
  particular, in the amplitude‐versus‐offset analysis which has proved to be an effective
  technique to extract additional information from the recorded (prestack) data. With
  proper conditioning and processing of seismic data, and separating amplitude variations
  due to changes in reflectivity from variations due to other effects, the resulting
  offset signatures have been successfully used, for instance, to distinguish true
  bright spots due to gas‐bearing sands, from false ones associated with lithological
  changes. To interpret the observed amplitude‐versus‐offset signatures, it is necessary
  to know the reflection coefficients as a function of angle and frequency for planar
  interfaces, as well as for other structures of geological interest. The modelling
  is first validated by computing the reflection coefficients for planar interfaces,
  and then used to analyse the reflection signatures of thin beds, corrugated interfaces
  and multilayers. Their implications, as well as impact on amplitude‐versus‐offset
  analysis, are discussed. We conclude that elastic modelling is an effective and
  valuable tool to further our understanding of the amplitude anomalies observed in
  field data. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved
