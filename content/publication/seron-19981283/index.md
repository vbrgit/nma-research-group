abstract: Numerical solution of the elastic wave equation has proven to be a very
  valuable tool For genphyscists in forward modeling and migration. Among the techniques
  generally used in modeling wave propagation we conaider in this paper the finite
  element method, focusing our attention on accuracy and computational requirements.
  The study has been carried out using several algorithms for time integration; Central
  Differences (explicit and implicit), Newmark, Wilson and Houholt. The lesulting
  large sparse system of linear equations is solid using both direct and iterative
  methods. For the direc. method the matrix is represented using the skyline storage
  scheme, while for iterative methods the row-wise and the compressed diagonal schemes
  have been used. The numerical methods have been implemented on an IBM 3090 vector
  multiprocessor. Performance data for the different implementations are presented
  and compared with data previously obtained using pseudo-spectral and finite differences
  methods on the same architecture. From our results it is c ncludcd that Newmark
  and Explicit Central Differences arc the mast adequate integration methods and Conjugate
  Gradient with compressed diagonal storage scherc is the most efficient solver for
  vector computers. Â© 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.
