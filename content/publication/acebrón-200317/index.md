abstract: We study a system of globally coupled two-dimensional nonlinear oscillators
  [using the two-junction superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) as a
  prototype for a single element] each of which can undergo a saddle-node bifurcation
  characterized by the disappearance of the stable minima in its potential energy
  function. This transition from fixed point solutions to spontaneous oscillations
  is controlled by external bias parameters, including the coupling coefficient. For
  the deterministic case, an extension of a center-manifold reduction, carried out
  earlier for the single oscillator, yields an oscillation frequency that depends
  on the coupling; the frequency decreases with coupling strength and/or the number
  of oscillators. In the presence of noise, a mean-field description leads to a nonlinear
  Fokker-Planck equation for the system which is investigated for experimentally realistic
  noise levels. Furthermore, we apply a weak external time-sinusoidal probe signal
  to each oscillator and use the resulting (classical) resonance to determine the
  underlying frequency of the noisy system. This leads to an explanation of earlier
  experimental results as well as the possibility of designing a more sensitive SQUID-based
  detection system. © 2003 The American Physical Society.
