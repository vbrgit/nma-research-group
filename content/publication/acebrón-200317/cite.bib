 abstract = {We study a system of globally coupled two-dimensional nonlinear oscillators [using the two-junction superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) as a prototype for a single element] each of which can undergo a saddle-node bifurcation characterized by the disappearance of the stable minima in its potential energy function. This transition from fixed point solutions to spontaneous oscillations is controlled by external bias parameters, including the coupling coefficient. For the deterministic case, an extension of a center-manifold reduction, carried out earlier for the single oscillator, yields an oscillation frequency that depends on the coupling; the frequency decreases with coupling strength and/or the number of oscillators. In the presence of noise, a mean-field description leads to a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation for the system which is investigated for experimentally realistic noise levels. Furthermore, we apply a weak external time-sinusoidal probe signal to each oscillator and use the resulting (classical) resonance to determine the underlying frequency of the noisy system. This leads to an explanation of earlier experimental results as well as the possibility of designing a more sensitive SQUID-based detection system. © 2003 The American Physical Society.},
