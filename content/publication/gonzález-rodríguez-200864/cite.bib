 abstract = {We study light propagation in a half-space composed of two homogeneous layers each having different optical properties from the other. This problem is a model for light propagation in tissues composed of a thin epithelial layer supported from below by a thick stromal layer. The interface between the two layers is irregular. Assuming that this interface is a small perturbation of a plane that is parallel to the boundary surface, we obtain an asymptotic approximation to the solution. We give a numerical method to compute this asymptotic approximation. Finally, we show how to recover this irregular interface surface from boundary measurements when the optical properties of the two layers are known. © 2007 Optical Society of America.},
