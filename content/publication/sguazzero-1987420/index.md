abstract: The Stacking Velocity Analysis of seismic reflection data is based on the
  approximation of the traveltime curves in Common-Depth-Point (CDP) gathers with
  hyperbolic trajectories. The analysis is customarily performed in the \"physical\"
  offset-time framework and produces a timevelocity histogram, the Velocity Spectrum.
  The accuracy of the velocity estimates depends on the adequacy of the CDP model
  to the earth's structure, the quality of the data, and the resolving power of the
  estimation method chosen. In this last regard a very important role is played by
  the optimality criterion, i.e., the functional to be maximized. This paper introduces
  a new class of complex-valued coherency functionals operating on complex-valued
  traces, designed to emphasize phase correlation and to reduce the estimate uncertainty.
  The algorithms are evaluated on test cases using synthetic and field data. In particular,
  it is shown that higher resolutions can be obtained postprocessing the complex coherency
  spectra with a suitable phase-enhancement technique. Â© 1996-2018 Society of Exploration
