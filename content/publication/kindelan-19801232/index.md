abstract: The paper describes an investigation that was conducted to develop a mathematical
  model based solely on primary boundary conditions and including the heat storage
  capacity of the soil. The soil is modelled by a two-dimensional heat conduction
  equation and the temperature at a certain depth is specified as boundary condition.
