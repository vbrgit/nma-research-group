abstract: We have determined the capture and emission coefficients by EL2 traps in
  semi-insulating n-GaAs using available experimental results. To this end, we have
  derived a simplified mathematical model from the complete drift-diffusion equations
  by singular perturbation methods. The capture and emission coefficients are adjusted
  so that the numerically obtained steady-state and high-field charge dipole solutions
  of the simplified model match the available experimental results. Â© 1999 American
  institute of Physics.
