abstract: Certain equations with integral constraints have as solutions time-periodic
  pulses of a fieldlike unknown while a currentlike unknown oscillates periodically
  with time. A general asymptotic theory of this phenomenon, the generalized Gunn
  effect, has been found recently. Here we extend this theory to the case of nonlinearities
  having only one stable zero, which is the case for the usual Gunn effect in n-GaAs.
  Our ideas are presented in the context of a simple scalar model where the waves
  can be constructed analytically and explicit expressions for asymptotic approximations
  can be found. Â© 2005 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.
