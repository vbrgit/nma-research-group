abstract: 'We reconstruct images of the absorption and the scattering coefficients
  for diffuse optical tomography using five different models for light propagation
  in tissues: (1) the radiative transport equation, (2) the delta-Eddington approximation,
  (3) the Fokker-Planck approximation, (4) the Fokker-Planck- Eddington approximation
  and (5) the generalized Fokker-Planck-Eddington approximation. The last four models
  listed are approximations of the radiative transport equation that take into account
  forward-peaked scattering analytically. Using simulated data from the numerical
  solution of radiative transport equation, we solve the inverse problem for the absorption
  and scattering coefficients using the transport-backtransport method. Through comparison
  of the numerical results, we show that all of these light scattering models produce
  good image reconstructions. In addition, we show that these approximations afford
  considerable computational savings over solving the radiative transport equation.
  However, all of the models exhibit significant \"crosstalk\" between absorption
  and scattering coefficient images. Among the approximations, we have found that
  the generalized Fokker-Planck- Eddington equation produced the best image reconstructions
  in comparison with the image reconstructions produced by the radiative transport
  equation. Â© 2009 Optical Society of America.'
