 abstract = {We reconstruct images of the absorption and the scattering coefficients for diffuse optical tomography using five different models for light propagation in tissues: (1) the radiative transport equation, (2) the delta-Eddington approximation, (3) the Fokker-Planck approximation, (4) the Fokker-Planck- Eddington approximation and (5) the generalized Fokker-Planck-Eddington approximation. The last four models listed are approximations of the radiative transport equation that take into account forward-peaked scattering analytically. Using simulated data from the numerical solution of radiative transport equation, we solve the inverse problem for the absorption and scattering coefficients using the transport-backtransport method. Through comparison of the numerical results, we show that all of these light scattering models produce good image reconstructions. In addition, we show that these approximations afford considerable computational savings over solving the radiative transport equation. However, all of the models exhibit significant "crosstalk" between absorption and scattering coefficient images. Among the approximations, we have found that the generalized Fokker-Planck- Eddington equation produced the best image reconstructions in comparison with the image reconstructions produced by the radiative transport equation. © 2009 Optical Society of America.},
