abstract: We present and numerically solve a model of the photorefractive Gunn effect.
  We find that high-field domains can be triggered by phase-locked interference fringes,
  as has been recently predicted on the basis of linear stability considerations.
  Since the Gunn effect is intrinsically nonlinear, we find that such considerations
  give at best order-of-magnitude estimations of the parameters critical to the photorefractive
  Gunn effect. The response of the system is much more complex, including multiple
  wave shedding from the injecting contact, wave suppression, and chaos with spatial
  structure. Â© 1998 The American Physical Society.
