 abstract = {We review the occurrence of electric-field domains in doped superlattices within a discrete drift model. A complete analysis of the construction and stability of stationary field profiles having two domains is carried out. As a consequence, we can provide a simple analytical estimation for the doping density above which stable domains occur. This bound may be useful for the design of superlattices exhibiting self-sustained current oscillations. Furthermore we explain why stable domains occur in superlattices in contrast to the usual Gunn diode. © 1997 The American Physical Society.},
