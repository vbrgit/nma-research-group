abstract: Laminar flame propagation is an important problem in combustion modelling
  for which great advances have been achieved both in its theoretical understanding
  and in the numerical solution of the governing equations in 2D and 3D. Most of these
  numerical simulations use finite difference techniques on simple geometries (channels,
  ducts,...) with equispaced nodes. The objective of this work is to explore the applicability
  of the radial basis function generated finite difference (RBF-FD) method to laminar
  flame propagation modelling. This method is specially well suited for the solution
  of problems with complex geometries and irregular boundaries. Another important
  advantage is that the method is independent of the dimension of the problem and,
  therefore, it is very easy to apply in 3D problems with complex geometries. In this
  work we use the RBF-FD method to compute 2D and 3D numerical results that simulate
  premixed laminar flames with different Lewis numbers propagating in open ducts.
