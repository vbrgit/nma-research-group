abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to investigate some stability issues observed
  in the surface shape reconstruction algorithm of 3-D irregular breast tumors. The
  developed algorithm is based on integrating the method of moments (MoM) for the
  forward solver with the adjoint-field scheme for the computations of appropriate
  sensitivities derivaties. The results show that the stability of the algorithm relies
  on the manner in which the adjoint fields are calculated. Â© 2007 IEEE.
