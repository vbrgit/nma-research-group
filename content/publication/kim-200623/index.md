abstract: We study the inverse fluorescent source problem for optical molecular imaging.
  In particular, we recover key properties of a fluorescent source inside a halfspace
  composed of a uniform absorbing and scattering medium from angularly resolved measurements
  at the boundary plane. We use the radiative transport equation to model the multiple
  scattering of light in tissues. Using Green's function, given as an analytical expansion
  in plane wave solutions, we subtract contributions from the measured angular data
  due to surface sources yielding a quantity that depends only on the interior fluorescent
  source. We analyse this reduced problem and obtain explicit solutions for a point
  source and a voxel source. Using the point source and voxel source solutions, we
  estimate the location, size and total strength of a general source. We perform numerical
  studies to validate this theory as well as investigate modelling errors due to incorrectly
  assumed optical properties of the medium. Â© 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.
