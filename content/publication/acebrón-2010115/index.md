abstract: Nowadays supercomputers have already entered in the petascale computing
  era and peak rate performance is dramatically increasing year after year. However,
  most of current algorithms are not capable of exploiting fully such a technology
  due to the well-known parallel programming related issues, such as synchronization,
  communication and fault tolerance. The aim of this paper is to present a probabilistic
  domain decomposition algorithm based on generating suitable random trees for solving
  nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations. These are of paramount importance
  since many important scientific and engineering problems are modeled by such type
  of differential equations. We stress that such algorithm is perfectly suited for
  both current and future high performance supercomputers, showing a remarkable performance
  and arbitrary scalability. While classical algorithms based on a deterministic domain
  decomposition exhibits strong limitations when increasing the size of the problem
  and the number of processors involved, probabilistic methods rather allow us to
  exploit efficiently massively parallel architectures, being the problem fully decoupled.
  Large-scale simulations runned on a high performance supercomputer confirm such
  properties. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.
