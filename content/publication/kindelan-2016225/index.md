abstract: We propose a new approach to study Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation
  in the limit of increasingly flat functions. The new approach is based on the semi-analytical
  computation of the Laurent series of the inverse of the RBF interpolation matrix
  described in a previous paper [3]. Once the Laurent series is obtained, it can be
  used to compute the limiting polynomial interpolant, the optimal shape parameter
  of the RBFs used for interpolation, and the weights of RBF finite difference formulas,
  among other things. Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.
