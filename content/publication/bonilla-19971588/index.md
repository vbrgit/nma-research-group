abstract: The continuum limit of a recently proposed model for charge transport in
  resonant-tunneling semiconductor superlattices (SLs) is analyzed. It is described
  by a nonlinear hyperbolic integrodifferential equation on a one-dimensional spatial
  support, supplemented by shock and entropy conditions. For appropriate parameter
  values, a time-periodic solution is found in numerical simulations of the model.
  An asymptotic theory shows that the time-periodic solution is due to recycling and
  motion of shock waves representing domain walls connecting regions of the SL where
  the electric field is almost uniform.
