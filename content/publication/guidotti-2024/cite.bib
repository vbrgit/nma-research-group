 abstract = {We propose a novel stochastic algorithm that randomly samples entire rows and columns of the matrix as a way to approximate an arbitrary matrix function using the power series expansion. This contrasts with existing Monte Carlo methods, which only work with one entry at a time, resulting in a significantly better convergence rate than the original approach. To assess the applicability of our method, we compute the subgraph centrality and total communicability of several large networks. In all benchmarks analyzed so far, the performance of our method was significantly superior to the competition, being able to scale up to 64 CPU cores with remarkable efficiency. © The Author(s) 2024.},
