abstract: We review, implement, and compare numerical integration schemes for spatially
  bounded diffusions stopped at the boundary which possess a convergence rate of the
  discretization error with respect to the timestep h higher than oh. We address specific
  implementation issues of the most general-purpose of such schemes. They have been
  coded into a single Matlab program and compared, according to their accuracy and
  computational cost, on a wide range of problems in up to R48. The paper is self-contained
  and the code will be made freely downloadable. © 2016 Global-Science Press.
