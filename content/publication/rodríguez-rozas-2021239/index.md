abstract: 'We review the Probabilistic Domain Decomposition (PDD) method for the numerical
  solution of linear and nonlinear Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems. This
  Domain Decomposition (DD) method is based on a suitable probabilistic representation
  of the solution given in the form of an expectation which, in turns, involves the
  solution of a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). While the structure of the
  SDE depends only upon the corresponding PDE, the expectation also depends upon the
  boundary data of the problem. The method consists of three stages: (i) only few
  values of the sought solution are solved by Monte Carlo or Quasi-Monte Carlo at
  some interfaces; (ii) a continuous approximation of the solution over these interfaces
  is obtained via interpolation; and (iii) prescribing the previous (partial) solutions
  as additional Dirichlet boundary conditions, a fully decoupled set of sub-problems
  is finally solved in parallel. For linear parabolic problems, this is based on the
  celebrated Feynman-Kac formula, while for semilinear parabolic equations requires
  a suitable generalization based on branching diffusion processes. In case of semilinear
  transport equations and the Vlasov-Poisson system, a generalization of the probabilistic
  representation was also obtained in terms of the Method of Characteristics (characteristic
  curves). Finally, we present the latest progress towards the extension of the PDD
  method for nonlocal fractional operators. The algorithm notably improves the scalability
  of classical algorithms and is suited to massively parallel implementation, enjoying
  arbitrary scalability and fault tolerance properties. Numerical examples conducted
  in 1D and 2D, including some for the KPP equation and Plasma Physics, are given.
