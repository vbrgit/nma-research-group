abstract: Radial basis function-generated finite difference (RBF-FD) approximations
  generalize classical grid-based finite differences (FD) from lattice-based to scattered
  node layouts. This greatly increases the geometric flexibility of the discretizations
  and makes it easier to carry out local refinement in critical areas. Many different
  types of radial functions have been considered in this RBF-FD context. In this study,
  we find that (i) polyharmonic splines (PHS) in conjunction with supplementary polynomials
  provide a very simple way to defeat stagnation (also known as saturation) error
  and (ii) give particularly good accuracy for the tasks of interpolation and derivative
  approximations without the hassle of determining a shape parameter. In follow-up
  studies, we will focus on how to best use these hybrid RBF polynomial bases for
  FD approximations in the contexts of solving elliptic and hyperbolic type PDEs.
