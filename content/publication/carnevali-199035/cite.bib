 abstract = {A simple model is described, which can be used to estimate execution times of vectorized FORTRAN loops on the IBM 3090/VF. Although a number of simplifying assumptions are made in the model (especially concerning the modeling of the cache), the resulting estimates are roughly correct in many cases. In situations where this model is oversimplified or unrealistic, it can still be used as a starting point for more sophisticated performance predictions. Â© 1990.},
