abstract: A simple model is described, which can be used to estimate execution times
  of vectorized FORTRAN loops on the IBM 3090/VF. Although a number of simplifying
  assumptions are made in the model (especially concerning the modeling of the cache),
  the resulting estimates are roughly correct in many cases. In situations where this
  model is oversimplified or unrealistic, it can still be used as a starting point
  for more sophisticated performance predictions. Â© 1990.
