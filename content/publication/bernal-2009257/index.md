abstract: A general and easy-to-code numerical method based on radial basis functions
  (RBFs) collocation is proposed for the solution of delay differential equations
  (DDEs). It relies on the interpolation properties of infinitely smooth RBFs, which
  al-low for a large accuracy over a scattered and relatively small discretization
  support. Hardy's multiquadric is chosen as RBF and combined with the Residual Subsampling
  Algorithm of Driscoll and Heryudono for support adaptivity. The performance of the
  method is very satisfactory, as demonstrated over a cross-section of benchmark DDEs,
  and by comparison with existing general-purpose and specialized numerical schemes
  for DDEs. Â© 2009 Global Science Press.
