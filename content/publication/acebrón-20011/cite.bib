 abstract = {The existence of a bistable behavior between (partially) synchronized stationary states, occurring in large populations of nonlinearly coupled random oscillators, was studied. This was done in the framework of the so-called Kuramot model. A central peak in the natural frequency distribution allowed for the existence of bistability between stationary solutions.},
