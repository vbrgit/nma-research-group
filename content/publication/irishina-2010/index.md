abstract: We present a new inversion strategy for the early detection of breast cancer
  from microwave data which is based on a new multiphase level set technique. This
  novel structural inversion method uses a modification of the color level set technique
  adapted to the specific situation of structural breast imaging taking into account
  the high complexity of the breast tissue. We only use data of a few microwave frequencies
  for detecting the tumors hidden in this complex structure. Three level set functions
  are employed for describing four different types of breast tissue, where each of
  these four regions is allowed to have a complicated topology and to have an interior
  structure which needs to be estimated from the data simultaneously with the region
  interfaces. The algorithm consists of several stages of increasing complexity. In
  each stage more details about the anatomical structure of the breast interior is
  incorporated into the inversion model. The synthetic breast models which are used
  for creating simulated data are based on real MRI images of the breast and are therefore
  quite realistic. Our results demonstrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed
  level set technique for detecting, locating and characterizing a small tumor in
  its early stage of development embedded in such a realistic breast model. Both the
  data acquisition simulation and the inversion are carried out in 2D. © 2010 IOP
