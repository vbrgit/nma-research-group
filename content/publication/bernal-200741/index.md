abstract: Recently, very intensive efforts have been devoted to develop meshless or
  element free methods that eliminate the need of element connectivity in the solution
  of PDEs. The motivation is to cut down modelling costs in industrial applications
  by avoiding the labor intensive step of mesh generation. In addition, these methods
  are particularly attractive in problems with moving interfaces since no remeshing
  is necessary. In this paper, we address the problem of injection molding described
  as a free boundary problem defined by conservation equations for mass, momentum
  and energy. This model can be dramatically simplified assuming that the mould is
  thin so that a Hele-Shaw approximation can be used. In this case the momentum equation
  is just a 2D elliptic equation whose solution yields the pressure distribution in
  the filled region of the mould. From this pressure field, the velocity distribution
  can be computed and the location of the advancing front can be updated. Therefore,
  this problem is very well suited to meshfree techniques and, in this paper, we use
  a radial basis function (RBF) method which is based on the interpolation and collocation
  of global shape functions, and for simplicity assume a Newtonian fluid so that the
  model is linear. In particular, we use multiquadric (MQ) RBFs which have been shown
  to have exponential convergence. To advance the front we use a level set method
  which is very efficient for this type of problems because it is very fast and can
  handle both front collisions and front break-ups without difficulty.
