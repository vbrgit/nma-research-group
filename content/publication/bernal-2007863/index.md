abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of injecting a non-Newtonian fluid
  into a thin cavity. Using the Hele-Shaw approximation the problem reduces to a moving
  boundary problem in which the pressure is described by a 2D, nonlinear, elliptic
  equation. Mesh-free methods are very well suited for the numerical solution of moving
  boundary problems since no remeshing is needed at each time step to correctly represent
  the boundary. Among these methods, we have chosen the asymmetric RBF collocation
  method (Kansa's method) to compute the pressure distribution. Kansa's method is
  truly mesh-free, and is one of the most frequently used methods due to its accuracy
  and ease of implementation. Once the pressure is known, the velocity at each point
  in the moving front is computed and, therefore, the location of the front can be
  updated. To efficiently model the front motion we use the level set method, which
  is very accurate, and can handle both front collisions and front break-ups without
  difficulty. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
