abstract: We propose a self-consistent microscopic model of vertical sequential tunneling
  through multiple quantum wells. The model includes a detailed description of the
  contacts, uses the transfer Hamiltonian for expressions of the current and it treats
  the Coulomb interaction within a mean-field approximation. We analyze the current
  density through a double well and a superlattice and study the formation of electric-field
  domains and multistability coming from the Coulomb interaction. Phase diagrams of
  parameter regions (bias and doping in the heterostructure and in the contacts, etc.ldots),
  where the different solutions exist, are given. Â© 1997 The American Physical Society.
