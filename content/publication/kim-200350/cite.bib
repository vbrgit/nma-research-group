 abstract = {In this paper, we present a method for computing direct numerical simulations of narrow optical beam waves propagating and scattering in a plane-parallel medium. For these computations, we use Fourier and Chebyshev spectral methods for three-dimensional radiative transfer that also includes polar and azimuthal angle dependences. We treat anisotropic scattering with peaked forward scattering by using a Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rule for the polar angle and an extended trapezoid rule for the azimuthal angle. To verify our results, we compare this spectral method to Monte Carlo simulations. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
