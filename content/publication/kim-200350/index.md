abstract: In this paper, we present a method for computing direct numerical simulations
  of narrow optical beam waves propagating and scattering in a plane-parallel medium.
  For these computations, we use Fourier and Chebyshev spectral methods for three-dimensional
  radiative transfer that also includes polar and azimuthal angle dependences. We
  treat anisotropic scattering with peaked forward scattering by using a Clenshaw-Curtis
  quadrature rule for the polar angle and an extended trapezoid rule for the azimuthal
  angle. To verify our results, we compare this spectral method to Monte Carlo simulations.
