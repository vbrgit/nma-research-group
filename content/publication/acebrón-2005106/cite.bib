 abstract = {A number of features relevant to stochastic dynamical systems, such as moments of solutions and first passage times, can be efficiently computed resorting to sequences of quasi-random numbers (low-discrepancy sequences). This method represents an alternative choice to the use of pseudorandom numbers, provided that a special care is paid to keep sufficiently uncorrelated as well as uniform the former sequences. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.
