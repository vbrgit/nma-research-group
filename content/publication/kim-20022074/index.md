abstract: We study the performance of Chebyshev spectral methods for time-dependent
  radiative transfer equations. Starting with a method for one-dimensional problems
  in homogeneous media, we show that the modifications needed to consider more general
  problems such as inhomogeneous media, polarization, and higher dimensions are straightforward.
  In this method, we approximate the spatial dependence of the intensity by an expansion
  of Chebyshev polynomials. This yields a coupled system of integro-differential equations
  for the expansion coefficients that depend on angle and time. Next, we approximate
  the integral operation on the angle variables using a Gaussian quadrature rule resulting
  in a coupled system of differential equations with respect to time. Using a second-order
  finite difference approximation, we discretize the time variable. We solve the resultant
  system of equations with an efficient algorithm that makes Chebyshev spectral methods
  competitive with other methods for radiative transfer equations.
