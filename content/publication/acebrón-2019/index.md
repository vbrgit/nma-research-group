abstract: A Monte Carlo method for computing the action of a matrix exponential for
  a certain class of matrices on a vector is proposed. The method is based on generating
  random paths, which evolve through the indices of the matrix, governed by a given
  continuous-time Markov chain. The vector solution is computed probabilistically
  by averaging over a suitable multiplicative functional. This representation extends
  the existing linear algebra Monte Carlo-based methods, and was used in practice
  to develop an efficient algorithm capable of computing both, a single entry or the
  full vector solution. Finally, several relevant benchmarks were executed to assess
  the performance of the algorithm. A comparison with the results obtained with a
  Krylov-based method shows the remarkable performance of the algorithm for solving
  large-scale problems. Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.
