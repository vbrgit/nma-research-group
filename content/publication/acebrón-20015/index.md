abstract: Bistability between synchronized stationary states is shown to occur in
  large populations of nonlinearly coupled random oscillators (Kuramoto model), governed
  by trimodal natural frequency distributions. Numerical simulations and a numerical
  investigation of bifurcating states provide evidence of global stability of such
  states, subject to unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal frequency distributions. All
  this may be important in the framework of large superconducting Josephson junctions
  arrays, as well as of neural networks. © 2001 The American Physical Society.
