abstract: The flow of a viscous fluid past a cylinder is a classical problem in fluid-structure
  interaction and a benchmark for numerical methods in computational fluid dynamics.
  We solve it with the recently introduced radial basis function-based partition of
  unity method (RBF-PUM), which is a spectrally convergent collocation meshless scheme
  well suited to this kind of problem. The resulting discrete system of nonlinear
  equations is tackled with a trust-region algorithm, whose performance is much enhanced
  by the analytic Jacobian which is provided alongside. Preliminary results up to
  Re = 60 with just 1292 nodes are shown. Â© 2017, Springer International Publishing
