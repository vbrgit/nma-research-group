 abstract = {We introduce a synthetic aperture imaging framework that takes into consideration directional dependence of the reflectivity that is to be imaged, as well as its frequency dependence. We use an l1 minimization approach that is coordinated with data segmentation so as to fuse information from multiple subapertures and frequency subbands. We analyze this approach from first principles and assess its performance with numerical simulations in an X-band radar regime. © 2016 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},
