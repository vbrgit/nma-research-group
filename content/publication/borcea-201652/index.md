abstract: We introduce a synthetic aperture imaging framework that takes into consideration
  directional dependence of the reflectivity that is to be imaged, as well as its
  frequency dependence. We use an l1 minimization approach that is coordinated with
  data segmentation so as to fuse information from multiple subapertures and frequency
  subbands. We analyze this approach from first principles and assess its performance
  with numerical simulations in an X-band radar regime. Â© 2016 Society for Industrial
  and Applied Mathematics.
