abstract: Full cross section calculations of ion-temperature-gradient-driven turbulence
  with Landau closure are being carried out as part of the Numerical Tokamak Turbulence
  Project, one of the U. S. Department of Energy's Phase II Grand Challenges. To include
  the full cross section of a magnetic fusion device like the tokamak requires more
  memory and CPU time than is available on the National Energy Research Scientific
  Computing Center's (NERSC's) shared-memory vector machines such as the CRAY C90
  and J90. Calculations of cylindrical multihelicity ion-temperature-gradient-driven
  turbulence were completed on NERSC's 160-processor distributed-memory CRAY T3E parallel
  computer with 256 Mbytes of memory per processor. This augurs well for yet more
  memory and CPU intensive calculations on the next-generation T3E at NERSC. This
  paper presents results on benchmarks with the current T3E at NERSC. Physics results
  pertaining to plasma confinement at the core of tokamaks subject to ion-temperature-
  gradient-driven-turbulence are also highlighted. Results at this resolution covering
  this extent of physical time were previously unattainable. Work is in progress to
  increase the resolution, improve the performance of the parallel code, and include
  toroidal geometry in these calculations in anticipation of the imminent arrival
  of a fully configured, 512-processor, T3E-900 model. Â© 1997 ACM.
