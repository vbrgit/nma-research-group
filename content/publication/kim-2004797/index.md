abstract: We calculate the radiance of a light beam propagating in a uniformly scattering
  and absorbing slab and determine the point-spread function. We do this by solving
  numerically the governing radiative transport equation by use of plane-wave mode
  expansions. When scattering is sharply peaked in the forward direction and it becomes
  difficult to solve the radiative transport equation, we replace it with either the
  Fokker-Planck or the Leakeas-Larsen equation. We also solve these equations by using
  plane-wave mode expansions. Numerical results show that these two equations agree
  with the radiative transport equation for large anisotropy factors. The agreement
  improves as the optical thickness increases. Â© 2004 Optical Society of America.
