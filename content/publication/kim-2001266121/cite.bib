 abstract = {The influence of relative refractive index on the depolarization of multiply scattered waves was investigated. Circularly and linearly polarized continuous waves incident on a medium with spherical scatterers showed dependence of circular depolarization length on refractive index. Circular depolarization systematically decreased after each scattering. Linear depolarization decreased with randomization of directions and was approximately equal to the transport mean free path.},
