 abstract = {The inertial effects on globally coupled oscillators were studied taking into account the effects of white noise, inertia, and spread in the natural frequency distribution on the oscillators. The linear stability of the incoherent solution of the oscillator populations was analyzed. The mode-coupling equations and incoherence and bifurcating stationary solutions for the incoherent solution system were determined.},
