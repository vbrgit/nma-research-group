abstract: We study partially polarized light propagation in random media governed
  by the theory of radiative transport. In particular, we derive a diffusion approximation
  when scattering is strong and absorption is weak. This diffusion approximation is
  substantially easier to solve than the vector radiative transport equation because
  it requires only the solution of a scalar problem. Included in this analysis is
  the derivation of a boundary layer solution that corrects the diffusion approximation
  near the boundaries and provides the means to derive boundary conditions for the
  diffusion approximation. We give an explicit solution for this boundary layer solution
  in terms of plane wave solutions that we calculate numerically using the discrete
  ordinate method. We evaluate the effectiveness of this diffusion approximation through
  comparison with the numerical solution of the full problem. Â© 2011 Society for Industrial
